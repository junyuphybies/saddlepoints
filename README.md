# quantum-noise-saddle-points
Numerical investigations for our paper on saddle points in the optimization landscape of variational quantum algorithms.

These are some examples of our codes. We are happy to provide the rest of the code for a reasonable request.

## Installation
The requirements.txt should provide you the details for all the quantum software you would need. Note, that this project uses older qiskit and pennylane versions. You are welcome to update the code for newer versions and open a pull request.
